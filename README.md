    I know this wasn't asked, but I thought I'd drop an additional note as to what getting this properly pushed entailed. I followed the procedure of : 
    
    1)Open the link J sent in discord
    2) Fork that repo into my own github, so that I would then have a repo
    3) Open VSCode and clone down that repo
    4) Added my date, time Initials (added this info after the inital commit. Will see this reflected in the version history on Github, and in VS code, I do believe.)
    5) Used "git checkout -b changes" to create a new branch in my repo to accept changes to files and to push to, so as to preserve a main, original un-altered copy of the repo.
    6) Used "git add . " to stage all my changes for commit.
    7) Set the "upstream" with "git push --set-upstream origin changes" so that my push would send the changes to the "changes" branch of my repo. 
    8) Went to my repo, created a pull request from my repo, to J's repo. 
    9) Added my comments for the pull request.
    10) Done! (Made a new commit to update the README with this info. Steps are simpler, just add, commit, push. )
